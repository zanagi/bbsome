	<h2>Marketing in Chinese social media</h2>
	<p>
		Marketing in Chinese social media comes with many challenges.
		The platforms are different, the language is different and the social media culture is different.
	</p>
	<p>
		We recommend Sina Weibo and WeChat as your Chinese social media platforms.
		We have grouped the marketing strategies into active and passive behavior.
		You may also implement a mix of these strategies according to your business.
		The strategy you choose greatly depends on the customer base of your company.
		If you deliver end consumer products and have the resources to spare, active marketing can be justified.
		If your products or services are of interest to a very small part of all Weibo and WeChat users or you only work in a b-to-b environment,
		we recommend passive use of Chinese social media. A common misconception is that marketing in Chinese social media is free.
		The amount of enterprises in the social media environment is huge and standing out in this sea of information requires much work.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first question you should ask yourself is: should I enter Chinese social media at all?
	</p>
	<p>
		The benefits can be great, but a poorly managed Weibo or WeChat page can cause damage to your brand.
		We want to state that in addition to increasing visibility for your company,
		being present in Chinese social media builds credibility for your enterprise.

		The benefits can be great, but a poorly managed Weibo or WeChat page can cause damage to your brand.
		We want to state that in addition to increasing visibility for your company,
		being present in Chinese social media builds credibility for your enterprise.
	</p>

	<h2>Rule #1: Get a good page manager</h2>
	<p>
		A page manager is a person who alone or with a team will manage you social media pages.
		Regardless of your strategy, you want a reliable pager manager or social media department.
		The manager or department has knowledge of the Chinese social media, is native in the language and understands your company.
		If you do not have a Chinese partner that could handle the management of you social media (see showcase Lifa Air),
		you will need to employ a page manager.
		Preferably, the person in question has experience of running business pages in Weibo and WeChat,
		lives in Finland and does not intend to move away soon.
		If such a perfect option is not found, we recommend contacting some Chinese university students in Finland.
		They might be excited to work part time for a Finnish company.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is very important that your page manager understands your company.
		This ensures that not only the text, but also the content is translated correctly.
		If you are running an interactive page, you should answer to comments and messages fast.
		This is important in Chinese social media culture, and failure to do so will portray a bad image of your company.
		We recommend close interaction with the page manager to keep yourself updated on what is happening in your social media endeavor.
		It helps if you page manager lives in the same timezone and country as you.
	</p>

	<h2>Posting</h2>
	<p>
		Your posts should be in accordance to your general branding strategy and capture the interest of the user.
		In addition, the posting frequency and timing is also important. Your posts should be distributed evenly over the week or month.
		Intensity should be determined and agreed on by you and your page manager.
		This intensity varies vastly between companies and can range from several posts daily to a post every second month.
		By posting, you want to spark interest in your followers and remind them that you exist.
		Too many posts gets annoying and makes it more difficult to think of interesting topics,
		while too few posts lets your relationship with your followers fade.
	</p>
	<p>
		The timing itself also needs some attention. As users tend to follow many pages, your posts do often not even appear on their newsfeed.
		The shown information is automatically filtered by Weibo when there are too many posts simultaneously (as on Facebook).
		Therefore, it makes sense to post when everyone else are not posting.
		The best time to post is discussed and depends on the target group,
		but outside of office hours other enterprises tend to post less which might give you an advantage.
		You will want to experiment with posting at different times of the day and learning from the experience.
		Weibo, as Facebook, provides information on how many users have seen you post.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is sometimes difficult for the person managing your page to think of interesting content.
		Therefore, it is a good idea to schedule coming posts and their types of content ahead of time.
		This avoids bad posts or lack of posts when the page manager is desperately trying to think of interesting topics for you page.
	</p>

	<h3>Post content</h3>
	<p>
		Your branding strategy should be determined and made clear to your page manager.
		Humor can be the most effective way to grab the user's attention and achieve as many views and shares as possible.
		If you have end consumer products, using humor is a valid option.
		If on the other hand the customers that you want to reach are business representatives, we recommend content that is more professional.
		This means that posts are generally informative and can consist of product release information or business news.
		It is always better if the post can be made interesting as well.
		These, serious kind of posts can be compared to news that you would publish on your company web page.
		According to Chinese social media expert Jocy Ma,
		the serious but professional approach suits the Finnish image in China and is thus appropriate.
	</p>
	<p>
		Jocy Ma recommends using trends to make your posts more appealing.
		Chinese users are more interested in trends than social media users in the western world.
		By using trends, you benefit from the user’s pre-set interest in your post.
		Following trends in practice means commenting on hot topics in your field, or commenting on current events.
		You may for example, post something related to the Chinese new year,
		or if you are a cleantech enterprise you might comment on news of air pollution in Beijing.
	</p>

	<h2>Typical pitfalls</h2>
	<h3>Entrusting a bad Chinese PR-company</h3>
	<p>
		This is the most common mistake that foreign companies do when entering the Chinese social media.
		See the showcases section for stories of what outsourcing your social media marketing to a Chinese PR-company might lead to.
		By outsourcing, you give away the reigns with which to steer your branding.
		If you lack the Chinese language skills, you even forfeit the ability to supervise your page.
	</p>
	<p>
		You might get lucky and find a provider that is actually doing well for you.
		Still, the chances are that they will not learn enough about your company and will post irrelevant content,
		not aligned with your branding strategy.
		In many cases the PR-companies have committed some or all of the major mistakes described below. Furthermore,
		the PR provider will often outsource the management of your page to third party, making it even harder for you to control your page.
	</p>

	<h3>Not answering clients</h3>
	<p>
		If you are running an active social media page in China, and a user posts on your page,
		the user expects answers within minutes or hours.
		There are examples of Finnish companies that hurt their brand image by failing to answer, or by answering very late.
	</p>
	<p>
		A prime example of this is Finnair. Finnair failed to answer their customers in a timely manner and thus hurt their image in China.
		Finnair has since improved the management of their Weibo page.
	</p>

	<h3>Clustering posts</h3>
	<p>
		You should distribute your posts evenly over time, even if your company has an eventful day.
		There are examples of companies posting five posts in one day after two weeks of complete silence on their page.
		This gives an unprofessional image of your enterprise and
		it is annoying for the user to get many notifications from the same page in one day.
	</p>

	<h3>No visibility</h3>
	<p>
		Sometimes a very good page will fail getting followers. This is a big problem if you are aiming for active marketing.
		If your page does not initially get a good amount of followers, it will not happen by itself.
		At this point, you should not sit and wait, but consider investing in visibility.
		It is also a good idea to promote your Weibo and WeChat pages during events where your customer segment is present.
		More options are described in the chapter “active marketing”.
	</p>

	<h2>Active Marketing</h2>
	<p>
		We recommend active marketing if you have a consumer product and you are ready to spend some money to gain visibility.
		A common mistake is thinking that active marketing in Chinese social media is free. Below we explain how to perform active marketing.
	</p>

	<h3>Active marketing on Weibo</h3>
	<p>
		There are three different ways to reach users in Weibo. The first two are the use of business functions and a “one hit viral” -campaign.
		Both of these entail managing your own page through a third party.
		The third and easiest option is not recommended. The option is to use a Chinese PR company to manage all your social media activity.
	</p>
	<h4>Business Function</h4>
	<p>
		Similar to western social media, such as Facebook,
		there is the option to buy business functions from Weibo.
		 You can buy ads that link to your page or add visibility to your posts in the same way as with Facebook's “boost” option.
		 You should discuss the use of these functions with your page manager.
		The success will depend largely on how attractive and “trendy” your product is.
	</p>
	<h4>"One hit viral"</h4>
	<p>
		Chinese social media expert Jocy Ma says that the more effective solution has usually been a “one hit viral” campaign.
		This is usually done by hiring a contractor to perform an intensive but short marketing campaign in social media,
		with the goal to achieve as many new followers as possible.
	</p>
	<h4>Using a Chinese PR company</h4>
	<p>
		The third, not recommended, option is getting a Chinese PR company to manage your page.
		There are problems with this solution. Firstly, the PR provider will probably not understand your company or the image you want to portray.
		This causes problems especially in answering to clients’ comments and questions.
		Secondly, it makes it more difficult for you to monitor your page and affect the content.
		Finding a trustworthy PR company is also difficult and chances are that you end up with a subcontractor
		that is not interested in doing a good job for you.
		If you lack Chinese language skills you will have no way of monitoring how you company is being portrayed.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, this option requires very little work and is probably the easiest option from your point of view.
	</p>
	<h4>“Reversed” online marketing</h4>
	<p>
		Online and offline marketing go hand in hand!
		Promote your Weibo page at events where your customer segment and others interested in your business are present.
		Street campaigns are also a common way to gain visibility since the Chinese social media is so flooded.
		Face-to-face interaction is often more effective, although more costly. If you do perform street campaigns,
		it is also a good time to acquire followers for your Weibo page.
		After gaining a decent initial amount of followers, it will be easier to gain more visibility in the viral environment.
	</p>


	<h3>Active marketing on WeChat</h3>
	<p>
		The most common way of acquiring new followers on WeChat is through Weibo.
		The two platforms are described in more detail in their respective articles.
		In short WeChat is a more closed environment and therefore it is more difficult to reach those who are not already following your page.
		In practice, the WeChat page is often advertised on the Weibo page and your new WeChat followers are already following you on Weibo.
		WeChat can however be more effective than Weibo as the visibility of your posts is greater.
		Thanks to WeChat being a closed environment the overflow of information is not as great,
		and users are more acceptable to information.
	</p>
	<h4>Opinion influencers</h4>
	<p>
		As always, word of mouth communication is the most effective way of marketing.
		WeChat brings new opportunities for this. You can employ “opinion influencers”,
		by offering users benefits if they get their friends to buy your products.
		In this way, you can reach much more people than the amount of followers that is shown on your WeChat page.
		Here is how this works in practice:
	</p>
	<p>
		The opinion influencer will get a code, which enables her to give a 10% discount on your product to any potential buyers.
		For every product she manages to sell, she will get 5% of the retail price.
		Now she has motivation to sell and the means with which to make sales.
		The opinion influencer will post information on your product in her private chats and tell her other friends about the product.
		From the point of view of the buyer, the opinion influencer is much more trustworthy than an ad on Weibo.
		Lifa Air for example has had great success using this method in sales in China.
	</p>



	<h2>Passive marketing</h2>
	<p>
		You can choose to use social media in a more passive way.
		Social media can be used for simply portraying information about your company, its news and products.
		If using the passive approach, your page basically serves as a web page, but more easily accessible by potential clients.
		This does not provide you with much visibility through social media, but will be less expensive.
		Even a passive page will make your company seem more professional, and serves for informing your clients of new products.
	</p>
	<p>
		If using this option, it is a good idea to inform you clients,
		potential buyers and other stakeholders of your Weibo page and gain followers in this way.
		In B2B, and especially cleantech, a large portion of clients is acquired through events.
		It is also a very good place to gain followers for your Weibo and WeChat pages.
		There is a scannable QR code -function for WeChat which makes it easy for users to follow your page.
		The QR code for your page should be present at events and street campaigns.
	</p>
	<h3>One page for Finland</h3>
	<p>
		A recommendation from Chinese social media expert Jocy Ma,
		is to cluster Finnish companies onto one Weibo page. The Weibo page would be managed centrally to save resources.
	</p>
	<h4>Benefits</h4>
	<p>
		The solution is based on the Team Finland -concept and would greatly benefit Finnish companies.
		Several companies, which are aiming for passive behavior in Chinese social media and work within the same category,
		could present themselves collectively in Weibo. Central management of the page decreases the use of resources per company.
	</p>
	<p>
		The bigger benefit is the increased visibility, gained for two reasons.
		Firstly, it is much more attractive for a user to follow one page with many companies offering products in the same category.
		We can therefore expect more users to follow the page.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second, even more effective reason comes from indirectly sharing customers.
		A company investing in cleantech might very well buy these products from several different suppliers.
		However, the cleantech market in China is huge and the Finnish market share is not large.
		By clustering the Finnish companies on one page it is likely that the Chinese client of
		one Finnish company will visit the common page and thus be exposed to the other Finnish companies.
		This leads to keeping customers within Team Finland.
	</p>
	<h4>Currently non-existent for cleantech companies from Finland</h4>
	<p>
		Such a collective page is not active at the moment but we recommend close teamwork with other Finnish cleantech enterprises.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a page on Weibo, called CleantechFinland.
		It promoted Finnish cleantech companies but has gone cold in June 2015, and has since not had a post.

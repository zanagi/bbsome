	<h2>Marketing in Chinese social media</h2>
	<p>
		Marketing in Chinese social media comes with many challenges.
		The platforms are different, the language is different and the social media culture is different.
	</p>
	<p>
		We recommend Sina Weibo and WeChat as your Chinese social media platforms.
		We have grouped the marketing strategies into active and passive behavior.
		You may also implement a mix of these strategies according to your business.
		The strategy you choose greatly depends on the customer base of your company.
		If you deliver end consumer products and have the resources to spare, active marketing can be justified.
		If your products or services are of interest to a very small part of all Weibo and WeChat users or you only work in a b-to-b environment,
		we recommend passive use of Chinese social media. A common misconception is that marketing in Chinese social media is free.
		The amount of enterprises in the social media environment is huge and standing out in this sea of information requires much work.
	</p>

	<p>
		The first question you should ask yourself is: should I enter Chinese social media at all?
	</p>
	<p>
		The benefits can be great, but a poorly managed Weibo or WeChat page can cause damage to your brand.
		We want to state that in addition to increasing visibility for your company,
		being present in Chinese social media builds credibility for your enterprise.

	<p>
		It is very important that your page manager understands your company.
		This ensures that not only the text, but also the content is translated correctly.
		If you are running an interactive page, you should answer to comments and messages fast.
		This is important in Chinese social media culture, and failure to do so will portray a bad image of your company.
		We recommend close interaction with the page manager to keep yourself updated on what is happening in your social media endeavor.
		It helps if you page manager lives in the same timezone and country as you.

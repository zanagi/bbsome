	<h2>Marketing in Chinese social media</h2>
	<p>
		We recommend Sina Weibo and WeChat as your Chinese social media platforms.
		We have grouped the marketing strategies into <b>active</b> and <b>passive</b> behavior. 
		Your strategy greatly depends on the customer base of your company. 
		If you deliver end consumer products and have the resources to spare, active marketing can be justified. 
		If you only work in a b-to-b environment or you are a small company, we recommend passive use of Chinese social media. 
		A common misconception is that marketing in Chinese social media is free. 
		The amount of enterprises in the social media environment is huge and standing out in this sea of information requires much work. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This section will first describe important aspects of all social media marketing in China and then concentrate on the different strategies. 
		We will give some examples of companies that have succeeded or failed in their SOME marketing.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Rule #1: Get a good page manager</h3>
	<p>
		Regardless of your strategy, you want a reliable pager manager that has knowledge of the Chinese social media, 
		is native in the language and understands your company. 
		Preferably the person in question has experience of running business pages in Weibo and WeChat, 
		lives in Finland and has no intention of moving away soon. 
		If such a perfect option is not found, we recommend contacting some Chinese university students in Finland. 
		They will often be excited to work part time for a Finnish company. 
	</p>
	<p>
		It is very important that your pagemanager understands your company. 
		This ensures that not only the text, but also the content is translated correctly. 
		Your page should also answer to comments and messages fast. 
		This is important in Chinese social media culture, and failure to do so will portray a bad image of your company. 
		We recommend close interaction with the pagemanager to keep yourself updated on the interaction on your page.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Posting</h3>
	<p>
		Your posts should be in accordance to your general branding strategy and capture the interest of the user. 
		In addition, the posting frequency and timing is also important. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Post content</h3>
	<p>
		Humor is often the most effective way to grab the user's attention and achieve as many views and shares as possible. 
		If you have end consumer products this is a valid option 
		but especially if you are trying to reach business representatives you should consider posting more professional content.
		Chinese social media expert Jocy Ma recommends using trends to make your posts more appealing. 
		Chinese users are more trend centered than in the western world, so the user will have a pre-set interest in your post. 
		Following trends in practice means commenting on hot topics in your field or current events. 
		You may, for example, post something related to the Chinese new year, 
		or if you are a cleantech enterprise you might comment on news of air pollution in Beijing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If on the other hand the customers that you want to reach are business representatives, 
		we recommend more professional content. 
		This means that posts are generally informative and can consist of product release information or business news. 
		Naturally it’s always better if the post can be made interesting as well. 
		The posts can be compared to news that you would publish on your company web page. 
		According to Jocy Ma, the serious but professional approach suits the Chinese image of Finnish companies and is thus appropriate.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first one is time. Your posts should be distributed evenly over the week or month. 
		Intensity should be determined and agreed on by you and your page manager. 
		Normal intensity for companies offering consumer products is xx and for companies in a b-to-b environment. 
		The timing itself also needs some attention. As users tend to follow many pages your posts do often not even appear on their news feed. 
		The shown information is automatically filtered by Weibo when there are too many posts simultaneously. 
		Therefore it will make sense to post when everybody else are not posting. 
		The timing itself is widely discussed and depends on the target group, but outside of office hours enterprises tend to post less. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Typical pitfalls</h3>
	<h4>Answering clients</h4>
	<p>
		Get a good pagemanager! 
		There are many examples of finnish companies hurting their brand image by entrusting their Weibo page to the cheapest PR company. 
	</p>
	<h4>Rule #2</h4>
	
	<h3>Active Marketing</h3>
	<h4>Reaching new customers and getting followers</h4>
	<p>
		There are 3 different ways to reach users in Weibo and WeChat. 
		The first two are the use of business functions and a “one hit viral” -campaign. 
		Both of these entail managing your own page through a third party. The third and easiest option is not recommended. 
		The option is to use a Chinese PR company to manage all your social media activity.
	</p>
	<h4>Business Function</h4>
	<p>
		Similar to western social media, such as Facebook, there is the option to buy business functions from Weibo. 
		You can buy ads that link to your page or add visibility to your posts in the same way as with the Facebook boost option. 
		You should discuss the use of these functions with your page manager. 
		The success will depend largely on how attractive and “trendy” your product is.
	</p>
	<h4>One hit viral</h4>
	<p>""</p>
	<h4>Using a Chinese PR company</h4>
	<p>
		The third, not recommended, option is getting a Chinese PR company to manage your page. 
		There are x problems with this solution. Firstly the PR company will probably not understand your company or the image you want to portray. 
		This causes problems especially in answering to clients comments and questions. 
		Secondly it makes it more difficult for you to monitor your page and affect the content.

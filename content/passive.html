  <h1>Passive marketing</h1>
	<p>
		You can choose to use social media in a more passive way.
		Social media can be used for simply portraying information about your company, its news and products.
		If using the passive approach, your page basically serves as a web page, but more easily accessible by potential clients.
		This does not provide you with much visibility through social media, but will be less expensive.
		Even a passive page will make your company seem more professional, and serves for informing your clients of new products.
	</p>
	<p>
		If using this option, it is a good idea to inform you clients,
		potential buyers and other stakeholders of your Weibo page and gain followers in this way.
		In B2B, and especially cleantech, a large portion of clients is acquired through events.
		It is also a very good place to gain followers for your Weibo and WeChat pages.
		There is a scannable QR code -function for WeChat which makes it easy for users to follow your page.
		The QR code for your page should be present at events and street campaigns.
	</p>
	<h3>One page for Finland</h3>
	<p>
		A recommendation from Chinese social media expert Jocy Ma,
		is to cluster Finnish companies onto one Weibo page. The Weibo page would be managed centrally to save resources.
	</p>
	<h4>Benefits</h4>
	<p>
		The solution is based on the Team Finland -concept and would greatly benefit Finnish companies.
		Several companies, which are aiming for passive behavior in Chinese social media and work within the same category,
		could present themselves collectively in Weibo. Central management of the page decreases the use of resources per company.
	</p>
	<p>
		The bigger benefit is the increased visibility, gained for two reasons.
		Firstly, it is much more attractive for a user to follow one page with many companies offering products in the same category.
		We can therefore expect more users to follow the page.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second, even more effective reason comes from indirectly sharing customers.
		A company investing in cleantech might very well buy these products from several different suppliers.
		However, the cleantech market in China is huge and the Finnish market share is not large.
		By clustering the Finnish companies on one page it is likely that the Chinese client of
		one Finnish company will visit the common page and thus be exposed to the other Finnish companies.
		This leads to keeping customers within Team Finland.
	</p>
	<h4>Currently non-existent for cleantech companies from Finland</h4>
	<p>
		Such a collective page is not active at the moment but we recommend close teamwork with other Finnish cleantech enterprises.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a page on Weibo, called CleantechFinland.
		It promoted Finnish cleantech companies but has gone cold in June 2015, and has since not had a post.

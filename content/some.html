		<p class="introduction-text col-sm-6">China has some of the largest social media userbases in the world. Some demographics say that the
		number of active social media users in China is more than double the population of U.S. Just imagine how much marketing potential
		there is in Chinese social media.

		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>
			With Facebook, Twitter and Youtube banned since 2009,
			China has consequently created its own platforms for social networking.
			As social media is an even larger phenomenon in China as it is in other countries,
			the potential for tapping its massive user base canâ€™t be overstated.
			Chinese internet users spend five to six hours more online per week than their
			American counterparts and 38% of consumers make product purchase decisions online.
			Understanding this space is vitally important for anyone trying to engage Chinese consumers.
			The Chinese social media landscape is also one of the most fragmented and unique in the world.
			The general trends for decision making for consumers as well as the basic rules for engaging with them effectively are,
			however, reassuringly familiar.

		<h1>Video sharing websites</h1>
		<p>
			Youtube is not used in China, instead there are several video-sharing websites in China.
			The two biggest are Youku and Sohu. The ones with the best video quality are iQiYi and QQ
		</p>

		<p>
			The video-sharing websites by themselves are not suitable marketing channels
			but the platforms should be used when you want to post videos on Weibo or WeChat.
			Some Finnish companies post their videos on all these platforms but choosing one will also be fine.
			As in Chinese social media, it is also important to answer to customer comments on the videos.
		</p>
		<p>
			Creating accounts on all these video-sharing websites is quite straightforward.

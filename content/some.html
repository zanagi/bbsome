		<p class="introduction-text col-sm-6">China has some of the largest social media userbases in the world. Some demographics say that the 
		number of active social media users in China is more than double the population of U.S. Just imagine how much marketing potential
		there is in Chinese social media.

		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>
			With Facebook, Twitter and Youtube banned since 2009, 
			China has consequently created its own platforms for social networking. 
			As social media is an even larger phenomenon in China as it is in other countries, 
			the potential for tapping its massive user base can’t be overstated. 
			Chinese internet users spend five to six hours more online per week than their 
			American counterparts and 38% of consumers make product purchase decisions online. 
			Understanding this space is vitally important for anyone trying to engage Chinese consumers. 
			The Chinese social media landscape is also one of the most fragmented and unique in the world. 
			The general trends for decision making for consumers as well as the basic rules for engaging with them effectively are, 
			however, reassuringly familiar.

		<h1><a href="#weibo">Weibo</a></h1>
		<p>
			China’s most popular microblogging website Sina Weibo, is very much like Twitter. 
			It gets used daily by over 100 million people or by over 30% of China’s internet users. 
			Weibo boasts a market penetration comparable to that of Twitter in the U.S. and therefore it has been widely adopted by companies
			- both national and international - as an effective marketing platform. 
			Notorious Asian celebrities can also be found on Weibo, as well as a host of media organisations. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Weibo covers the around 55%-85% of the Chinese micro blogging segment depending on the estimate. 
			This causes especially the most popular users to receive an excessive amount of attention, and to illustrate, 
			the top 100 of most popular users have a combined total of 485 million followers according to the iResearch 2011 report. 
			Although Weibo’s growth since its early years hasn’t been as explosive, 
			it remains a key channel for influencing Chinese public opinion in the corporate sense.

		<h1><a href="#wechat">WeChat</a></h1>
		<p>
			WeChat has been credited as the most influential app in China, and for good reason. 
			Its 650 million active users may use it to call their friends, send each other money, 
			play games, share “moments” or even pay electricity bills. 
			WeChat has a similar status within social media in China as Facebook in the West,
			but it is also broadly used in both casual and workplace micro messaging. 
		</p>
		<img src="http://amazing.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_4111.png" style="display:block; margin: 1em auto;width:50%;" alt="wechat_p"/>
		
		<p>
			For the above reasons, WeChat is frequently asserted as a combination of both Facebook and WhatsApp. 
			This Chinese social media behemoth, however, clearly has its own direction and vision too. 
			While WhatsApp’s co-founder Jan Koum proudly keeps a sign in his office that reads “No Ads! No Games! No Gimmicks!”, 
			WeChat has aimed to become a platform for a myriad of gimmicky features.
			One such handy feature is making use of localization data to find nearby people, 
			many of whom have started selling food or cosmetics through this channel. For the big Chinese cities, 
			WeChat is constantly experimenting on various tools to facilitate tasks such as ordering a taxi, or booking a doctor’s appointment. 
		</p>
		<p>
			One particularly entertaining function is the “Shake” function, 
			which let’s lonely users weed out automated advertisement profiles in search for another live 
			person by letting two users who simultaneously shake their phones to message one another. 
		</p>
		
		<h1>Video sharing websites</h1>
		<p>
			Youtube is not used in China, instead there are several video-sharing websites in China. 
			The two biggest are Youku and Sohu. The ones with the best video quality are iQiYi and QQ
		</p>
		<p>
			The video-sharing websites by themselves are not suitable marketing channels 
			but the platforms should be used when you want to post videos on Weibo or WeChat. 
			Some Finnish companies post their videos on all these platforms but choosing one will also be fine. 
			As in Chinese social media, it is also important to answer to customer comments on the videos.
		</p>
		<p>
			Creating accounts on all these video-sharing websites is quite straightforward.

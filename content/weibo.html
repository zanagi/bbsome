		<p>
			Weibo covers the around 55%-85% of the Chinese micro blogging segment depending on the estimate.
			This causes especially the most popular users to receive an excessive amount of attention, and to illustrate,
			the top 100 of most popular users have a combined total of 485 million followers according to the iResearch 2011 report.
			Although Weibo’s growth since its early years hasn’t been as explosive,
			it remains a key channel for influencing Chinese public opinion in the corporate sense.

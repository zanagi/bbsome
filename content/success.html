		<h1>Case Study: Lifa Air</h1>
		<p>
			The cleantech company Lifa Air has moved to the Chinese market in the beginning of 2015
			and has had great use of social media in their marketing.
			Lifa Air has a Chinese partner who manages their social media activity in cooperation with a Lifa Air representative.
			Edifier Technology invested 21 million euros in Lifa Air and they are now together producing an end consumer air purifier.
			Since their first launch of the air purifier product on 12th of October 2015,
			they have been very successful in sales. Lifa Air’s Weibo page has over 20 000 followers and their WeChat page about 10 000 (May 2016).

			In their campaigns, Lifa Air gives prizes that are drawn among users that comment on their posts.
			This motivates followers to be active on your page and increases visibility of your campaign.
		</p>
		<p>
			When we asked advice on marketing in Chinese social media,
			Eppu Mäkipää from Lifa Air had the following to say:
			“In social media you can save in the costs, but you need to work hard to achieve and maintain results.
			Your followers will certainly include smart, educated and critical people,
			so you need to be honest and accurate when making statements, otherwise it will be a blowback to you.”

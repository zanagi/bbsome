  <h1>Rule #1: Get a good page manager</h1>
	<p>
		A page manager is a person who alone or with a team will manage you social media pages.
		Regardless of your strategy, you want a reliable pager manager or social media department.
		The manager or department has knowledge of the Chinese social media, is native in the language and understands your company.
		If you do not have a Chinese partner that could handle the management of you social media (see showcase Lifa Air),
		you will need to employ a page manager.
		Preferably, the person in question has experience of running business pages in Weibo and WeChat,
		lives in Finland and does not intend to move away soon.
		If such a perfect option is not found, we recommend contacting some Chinese university students in Finland.
		They might be excited to work part time for a Finnish company.

			The content and timing of your posts is important. How about making a posting calendar beforehand?

    <h1>Posting</h1>
  	<p>
  		Your posts should be in accordance to your general branding strategy and capture the interest of the user.
  		In addition, the posting frequency and timing is also important. Your posts should be distributed evenly over the week or month.
  		Intensity should be determined and agreed on by you and your page manager.
  		This intensity varies vastly between companies and can range from several posts daily to a post every second month.
  		By posting, you want to spark interest in your followers and remind them that you exist.
  		Too many posts gets annoying and makes it more difficult to think of interesting topics,
  		while too few posts lets your relationship with your followers fade.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		The timing itself also needs some attention. As users tend to follow many pages, your posts do often not even appear on their newsfeed.
  		The shown information is automatically filtered by Weibo when there are too many posts simultaneously (as on Facebook).
  		Therefore, it makes sense to post when everyone else are not posting.
  		The best time to post is discussed and depends on the target group,
  		but outside of office hours other enterprises tend to post less which might give you an advantage.
  		You will want to experiment with posting at different times of the day and learning from the experience.
  		Weibo, as Facebook, provides information on how many users have seen you post.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		It is sometimes difficult for the person managing your page to think of interesting content.
  		Therefore, it is a good idea to schedule coming posts and their types of content ahead of time.
  		This avoids bad posts or lack of posts when the page manager is desperately trying to think of interesting topics for you page.
  	</p>

  	<h3>Post content</h3>
  	<p>
  		Your branding strategy should be determined and made clear to your page manager.
  		Humor can be the most effective way to grab the user's attention and achieve as many views and shares as possible.
  		If you have end consumer products, using humor is a valid option.
  		If on the other hand the customers that you want to reach are business representatives, we recommend content that is more professional.
  		This means that posts are generally informative and can consist of product release information or business news.
  		It is always better if the post can be made interesting as well.
  		These, serious kind of posts can be compared to news that you would publish on your company web page.
  		According to Chinese social media expert Jocy Ma,
  		the serious but professional approach suits the Finnish image in China and is thus appropriate.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Jocy Ma recommends using trends to make your posts more appealing.
  		Chinese users are more interested in trends than social media users in the western world.
  		By using trends, you benefit from the userâ€™s pre-set interest in your post.
  		Following trends in practice means commenting on hot topics in your field, or commenting on current events.
  		You may for example, post something related to the Chinese new year,
  		or if you are a cleantech enterprise you might comment on news of air pollution in Beijing.

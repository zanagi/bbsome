	<h1>Case study: Kalevala Jewelry</h1>
	<div style="display:block; margin: 1em auto; width: 400px">

	</div>
	<p>
		Kaleva Jewelry has a Weibo page which is not official.
		The page was made by an unknown fan.
		Fortunately the page is not active anymore.
		When it was active all the marketing posts were done with horrible translating.
		Most of the posts didn't make sense at all.
		This Weibo page still harms the Kalevala Jewelry's brand by making Kalevala seem unreliable.
	</p>

	<img src="images/ss/kalevala.png" width=400 height=300 alt="Kalevala main page">
</div>
	<p>For example, this post doesn't make any sense at all.
		It says: "Simple and clever sense of style "Ainoa" -series unique personal and configuring modern women offer unique jewelry accessories.”

	<h1>Case study: Finnair</h1>
	<div style="display:block; margin: 1em auto; width: 400px">

</div>
	<p>
		In the Chinese SOME culture it is expected to answer to questions fast.
		Chinese customers might sometimes use an airlines Weibo page when they have trouble with their flight,
		instead of going to the airlines customer service point at the airport.
		Finnair had not realized this.
		They had entrusted their social media marketing to a Chinese PR company with bad results.
		The failure to answer questions had resulted in a lot of negative comments on Finnair’s page,
		which the company itself had not noticed as they apparently lack Chinese language skills,
		or they had neglected monitoring their Weibo page.

	<h1>Case study: Iittala</h1>
	<div style="display:block; margin: 1em auto; width: 400px">

	<img src="images/ss/iittala_main.png" width=400 height=300 alt="Iittala main page">
</div>
	<p>Iittala uses Weibo as a Instagram.
		It simply posts photos and there is no interaction with the customers.
		Iittala should use Weibo more efficiently. A huge Chinese star and 3rd most followed person in Weibo,
		 Zhao Wei, who has 78 million followers on Weibo, is a fan of Iittala.
		 She even used her own collection in a popular TV series but Iittala failed to respond in any way.
		 Instead, some other medias have made articles about the tableware in the TV and introduced Iittala.
		 In short, Iittala failed to act when they had a huge opportunity.

	<h1>Case study: Kalevala Jewelry</h1>
	<div style="display:block; margin: 1em auto; width: 400px">

	</div>
	<p>
		Kaleva Jewelry has a Weibo page which is not official. The page was made by somebody that Kalevala doesn't know.
		Fortunately the page is not active anymore. When it was active all the marketing posts were done with horrible translating.
		Most of the posts didn't make sense at all.This Weibo page still harms the Kalevala Jewelry's brand by making Kalevala seem unreliable company.

	<img src="images/ss/kalevala.png" width=400 height=300 alt="Kalevala main page">
</div>
	<p>For example This post doesn't make any sense. It says: "Simple and clever sense of style  "Ainoa" -series unique personal and configuring modern women offer unique jewelry accessories.‚Äù

	<h1>Case study: Finnair</h1>
	<div style="display:block; margin: 1em auto; width: 400px">

	<img src="images/ss/finnair_main.png" width=400 height=300 alt="Finnair main page">
</div>
	<p>
		Finnair service Weibo account provided close to 0 service. It did not manage to respond properly to customers.
		Also it posted wrong information about Finnair and Finland.
		Later the manager was replaced and the biggest problem solved, but still there is a lot of room for improvement.

	<h1>Case study: Marimekko</h1>
	<div style="display:block; margin: 1em auto; width: 400px">

	<img src="images/ss/marimekko_main.png" width=400 height=300 alt="Marimekko main page">
</div>
<p>Also Marimekko didn't have the best manager at first and the posts content was poor.
	 Marimekko didn't have a lot of followers but after real-life activities and celebrity campaign it has improved.
	 Also the content is better nowadays. Bad Weibo page had negative influence on Marimekko's brand.

	<h1>Case study: Iittala</h1>
	<div style="display:block; margin: 1em auto; width: 400px">

	<img src="images/ss/iittala_main.png" width=400 height=300 alt="Iittala main page">
</div>
	<p>Iittala uses Weibo as a Instagram. It simple posts photos. There is no interaction with the customers.
		Iittala should use Weibo a lot more efficiently. For example big Chinese star is an Iittala fan and even used her own collection in a very popular TV series.
		However Iittala did not respond this in any way. Instead, some other medias have made articles about the tableware in the TV and introduced Iittala.
		Iittala could have made huge impact with that kind of marketing in China, but didn't

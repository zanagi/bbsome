	<h1>WeChat</h1>
<p>WeChat has been credited as the most influential app in China, and for good reason.
	Its 650 million active users may use it to call their friends, send each other money, play games, share “moments” or even pay electricity bills.
	WeChat has a similar status within social media in China as Facebook in the West,
  but it is also broadly used in both casual and workplace micro messaging.

<p>For the above reasons, WeChat is frequently asserted as a combination of both Facebook and WhatsApp.
	 This Chinese social media behemoth, however, clearly has its own direction and vision too.
	  While WhatsApp’s co-founder Jan Koum proudly keeps a sign in his office that reads “No Ads! No Games! No Gimmicks!”,
		WeChat has aimed to become a platform for a myriad of gimmicky features. One such handy feature is making use of localization data to find nearby people,
		 many of whom have started selling food or cosmetics through this channel. For the big Chinese cities,
		 WeChat is constantly experimenting on various tools to facilitate tasks such as ordering a taxi,
		 or booking a doctor’s appointment.

<p>One particularly entertaining function is the “Shake” function,
	which let’s lonely users weed out automated advertisement profiles in search for another live person by letting two users who simultaneously shake their phones to message one another.

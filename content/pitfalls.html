    <h1>Typical pitfalls</h1>
  	<h3>Entrusting a bad Chinese PR-company</h3>
  	<p>
  		This is the most common mistake that foreign companies do when entering the Chinese social media.
  		See the showcases section for stories of what outsourcing your social media marketing to a Chinese PR-company might lead to.
  		By outsourcing, you give away the reigns with which to steer your branding.
  		If you lack the Chinese language skills, you even forfeit the ability to supervise your page.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		You might get lucky and find a provider that is actually doing well for you.
  		Still, the chances are that they will not learn enough about your company and will post irrelevant content,
  		not aligned with your branding strategy.
  		In many cases the PR-companies have committed some or all of the major mistakes described below. Furthermore,
  		the PR provider will often outsource the management of your page to third party, making it even harder for you to control your page.
  	</p>

  	<h3>Not answering clients</h3>
  	<p>
  		If you are running an active social media page in China, and a user posts on your page,
  		the user expects answers within minutes or hours.
  		There are examples of Finnish companies that hurt their brand image by failing to answer, or by answering very late.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		A prime example of this is Finnair. Finnair failed to answer their customers in a timely manner and thus hurt their image in China.
  		Finnair has since improved the management of their Weibo page.
  	</p>

  	<h3>Clustering posts</h3>
  	<p>
  		You should distribute your posts evenly over time, even if your company has an eventful day.
  		There are examples of companies posting five posts in one day after two weeks of complete silence on their page.
  		This gives an unprofessional image of your enterprise and
  		it is annoying for the user to get many notifications from the same page in one day.
  	</p>

  	<h3>No visibility</h3>
  	<p>
  		Sometimes a very good page will fail getting followers. This is a big problem if you are aiming for active marketing.
  		If your page does not initially get a good amount of followers, it will not happen by itself.
  		At this point, you should not sit and wait, but consider investing in visibility.
  		It is also a good idea to promote your Weibo and WeChat pages during events where your customer segment is present.
  		More options are described in the chapter “active marketing”.

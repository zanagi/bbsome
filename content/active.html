    <h1>Active Marketing</h1>
  	<p>
  		We recommend active marketing if you have a consumer product and you are ready to spend some money to gain visibility.
  		A common mistake is thinking that active marketing in Chinese social media is free. Below we explain how to perform active marketing.

  	<h3>Active marketing on Weibo</h3>
  	<p>
  		There are three different ways to reach users in Weibo. The first two are the use of business functions and a “one hit viral” -campaign.
  		Both of these entail managing your own page through a third party.
  		The third and easiest option is not recommended. The option is to use a Chinese PR company to manage all your social media activity.
  	</p>
  	<h4>Business Function</h4>
  	<p>
  		Similar to western social media, such as Facebook,
  		there is the option to buy business functions from Weibo.
  		 You can buy ads that link to your page or add visibility to your posts in the same way as with Facebook's “boost” option.
  		 You should discuss the use of these functions with your page manager.
  		The success will depend largely on how attractive and “trendy” your product is.
  	</p>
  	<h4>"One hit viral"</h4>
  	<p>
  		Chinese social media expert Jocy Ma says that the more effective solution has usually been a “one hit viral” campaign.
  		This is usually done by hiring a contractor to perform an intensive but short marketing campaign in social media,
  		with the goal to achieve as many new followers as possiblele. According to Jocy Ma, the contractor with the best track record is “Genius Panda”.

  	</p>
  	<h4>Using a Chinese PR company</h4>
  	<p>
  		The third, not recommended, option is getting a Chinese PR company to manage your page.
  		There are problems with this solution. Firstly, the PR provider will probably not understand your company or the image you want to portray.
  		This causes problems especially in answering to clients’ comments and questions.
  		Secondly, it makes it more difficult for you to monitor your page and affect the content.
  		Finding a trustworthy PR company is also difficult and chances are that you end up with a subcontractor
  		that is not interested in doing a good job for you.
  		If you lack Chinese language skills you will have no way of monitoring how you company is being portrayed.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		However, this option requires very little work and is probably the easiest option from your point of view.
  	</p>
  	<h3>“Reversed” online marketing</h3>
  	<p>
  		Online and offline marketing go hand in hand!
  		Promote your Weibo page at events where your customer segment and others interested in your business are present.
  		Street campaigns are also a common way to gain visibility since the Chinese social media is so flooded.
  		Face-to-face interaction is often more effective, although more costly. If you do perform street campaigns,
  		it is also a good time to acquire followers for your Weibo page.
  		After gaining a decent initial amount of followers, it will be easier to gain more visibility in the viral environment.

  	<h3>Active marketing on WeChat</h3>
  	<p>
  		The most common way of acquiring new followers on WeChat is through Weibo.
  		The two platforms are described in more detail in <a href="#wechat">WeChat's</a> and <a href="#weibo">Weibo's</a> respective articles.
  		In short WeChat is a more closed environment and therefore it is more difficult to reach those who are not already following your page.
  		In practice, the WeChat page is often advertised on the Weibo page and your new WeChat followers are already following you on Weibo.
  		WeChat can however be more effective than Weibo as the visibility of your posts is greater.
  		Thanks to WeChat being a closed environment the overflow of information is not as great,
  		and users are more acceptable to information.

  	<h4>Opinion influencers</h4>
  	<p>
  		As always, word of mouth communication is the most effective way of marketing.
  		WeChat brings new opportunities for this. You can employ “opinion influencers”,
  		by offering users benefits if they get their friends to buy your products.
  		In this way, you can reach much more people than the amount of followers that is shown on your WeChat page.
  		Here is how this works in practice:
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		The opinion influencer will get a code, which enables her to give a 10% discount on your product to any potential buyers.
  		For every product she manages to sell, she will get 5% of the retail price.
  		Now she has motivation to sell and the means with which to make sales.
  		The opinion influencer will post information on your product in her private chats and tell her other friends about the product.
  		From the point of view of the buyer, the opinion influencer is much more trustworthy than an ad on Weibo.
  		<a href="#success">Lifa Air</a> for example has had great success using this method in sales in China.
